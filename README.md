# NFC Relay Attack Demonstration

This repository demonstrates a **basic relay attack in NFC** using two ACR122U readers and a PN532 module with a Raspberry Pi acting as a pseudo Point-of-Sale (POS).

---

## 📜 Overview

The project showcases how NFC communications can be intercepted and relayed between a victim card and a pseudo-POS device to simulate real-world relay attack scenarios.  
This is purely for **educational and research purposes** in the field of cybersecurity.

## 🛠 Hardware & Setup

- **Two [ACR122U](https://www.acs.com.hk/en/products/3/acr122u-usb-nfc-reader/) NFC Readers**
- **PN532 NFC Module**
- **Raspberry Pi** (used for the pseudo POS)

Pseudo POS setup reference:  
- Check `CIRC.jpg` for the pseudo POS circuit diagram.
